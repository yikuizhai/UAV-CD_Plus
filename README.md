## Introduction
UAV-CD+ dataset utilizes low-altitude droneimagery to complement existing urban building CD datasets.It addresses the need for detecting subtle changes and nonurban building changes, providing a new benchmark for CDand UAVbased CD tasks. The dataset was captured in aprefecture-level city in Guangdong Province and consists of2002 pairs of images captured by low-altitude drones. We partitioned the initial 2002 pairs ofimages into training, validation, and test sets, maintainingan 8:1:1 ratio. To address device performance limitations,we cropped the images into numerous pairs, each with apixel dimension of 256 x 256.
